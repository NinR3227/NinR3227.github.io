                        My journey into programming began in high school, where I was introduced to its wonders. Since then, I've been on a quest for knowledge, enrolling in various courses and delving deep into the world of technology. Now in my third year of college, I've rediscovered my passion for programming. It's not just a skillâ€”it's a passion that drives me to explore, innovate, and create. I eagerly anticipate the challenges ahead and look forward to contributing my skills to impactful projects.

                        I have here my first two Projects. I've created this just to practice my skills. I used this for my own satisfaction since I play a lot of games that uses timers for some things that needs to be done in-game. The card counter is what I've used when I am playing blackjack to help me keep track of what's really happening. The design of this projects is not appealing since I focused more on how it works.
